Team Goldsmile Entry for Ludum Dare 26 (4/2013; theme: "minimalism")
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To get started:

* install Lazarus for your platform (cross platform IDE for free pascal. we're using v1.0.8)
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/
* install SDL1.2-devel for your platform
  - http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
* fork and clone this repository
* run `cd make sync`

If you don't have `make` on your path already, you can use the copy
included with free pascal inside Lazarus.
