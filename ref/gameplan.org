#+title: gsld26 gameplan (theme: minimalism)

* game concept
** pacman style mazes, but no wraparound
** screens connect together like in zelda
** cat/mouse aspect
*** you are a little spaceship trying to evade capture
*** you have thrusters + shield (with some directional abilities)
*** guys chasing you have a tractor beam
*** no guns, just chasing/hiding (they want you alive)
*** ability to use the environment to get advantage???
**** something like the power pill in pac-man?

* phase 1 : generic game engine (port from [[http://gamesketchlib.org/][gamesketchlib]] / [[http://flixel.org][flixel]])
** TODO get guys on screen
** TODO generic stuff
*** screenflow system (strategy design pattern)
